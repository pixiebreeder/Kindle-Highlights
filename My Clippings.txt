mandatory sentences for drug offenses imposed by (largely White and middle class) Drug War officials, both Afro-Black young males and Latino-Brown ones, are to be found out of all proportion to their numbers in the society. The May 7, 1992 New York Times editorial which gives these statistics, also point out that it costs $25,000 a year "to keep a kid in prison; which is more than the Job Corps or college. " However, for society at large to choose the latter option in place of the former would mean that the "kids" in question could no longer be "perceived" in N.H.I. terms as they are now perceived by all; nor could they continue to be induced to so perceive themselves within these same terms, as they now do, fratricidally turning upon themselves, killing each other off in gang wars or by other violent methods. Where does this "inner eye" which leads the society to choose the former option in dealing with the North American variant of the jobless category of the post-Industrial New Poor [Bauman, 1987], the category to which at the global level, Frantz Fanon has given the name les damnés, the condemned, [Fanon, 1963] come from? Why is this "eye" so intricately bound up with that code, so determinant of our collective behaviours, to which we have given the name, race? "It seems" a sociology professor, Christopher Jenks, points out in the wake of the L.A."that we're always trying to reduce race to something else. Yet out there on the streets race does not reduce to something else. " [Chronicle of Higher Education, May 13, 1992] I have come to believe, after struggling with this issue from the "lay" perspective of Black Studies (which was itself able to enter academia only in the wake of the Civil Rights movement, the Watts urban riots, and the protests which erupted after the assassination of Martin Luther King), not only that "race" cannot be reduced

perceive and know itself as if it were a purely natural organism in complete continuity with organic life. For if, in the terms specific to the "local" culture [Geertz, 1983] of Western Europe, and therefore to its founding Judaeo-Christian Narrative of human emancipation [Griaule, 1948, Lyotard, 1989] the human had been represented as a divinely created being in the terms of the Biblical Genesis account of origins, the new conception of the human, that would be based during the nineteenth century on the new Narrative of Evolution, would be that of an evolutionarily selected being. In this conception the human was held to pre-exist the "local cultures," including ours, by means of which alone human "forms of life" can come to exist [D.T.Campbell, 1982; Lieberman, 1991], as the hybridly biological (bios) and narrative-discursive (logos) level of existence that they are [Wynter, 1991]. That is, as they are outside the mode of subjective understanding or "inner eyes" constituted by the "prescriptive categories" of the "native cultural model" [Legesse, 1973] which is itself rigorously elaborated by the present disciplinary paradigms of the Humanities and the Social Sciences. The Eritrean anthropologist Asmarom Legesse points out that our present organization of knowledge is premised on what he terms the technocultural fallacy. This fallacy, he asserts, derives from the failure of anthropology [and the other disciplines as well] to distinguish the purposive aspects of human behavior …and the unconscious structure in human culture (as reflected in language and the cognitive bases of life) from the nonconscious empirical processes that link man directly to animal societies and the ecosystem [to in effect economic processes] [Legesse, 1973] It is this fallacy which underlies the premise of the discipline of economics, (as the present master discipline in the place of theology), that our human behaviours are motivated primarily by the imperative common to all organic species of securing the material basis of their existence; rather than by imperative of securing the overall conditions of existence, (cultural, religious, representational and through their mediation, material), of each local culture's represented conception of the Self (Wittgenstein's "form of life). In this context, history falls into the trap of taking its narration of what happened in the past, a narration clearly oriented by our present culture specific conception of the human, as if indeed it were what actually happened, when seen from a transcultural perspective. The recent controversy over the California school textbook, America Will Be, which imagines the United States as a "nation of immigrants" provides an instructive example of the historical paradigm's conflation of narrative history with "history as what happened" [Waswo, 1988]. The classificatory logic of the acronym N.H.I. , (as well as the belief system of a David Duke for whom whilst the "Caucasian" incarnates the ostensibly most highly evolved and selected mode of "normal" human being, the "lower non-White races" and most ultimately the "Negro," incarnate the most atavistic non-evolved Lack of the human), derives therefore from a second fallacy related to the above; one which underlies our present disciplinary paradigms, and their hegemonic mode of4

-Copernicus Christian-Ptolemaic astronomy), the ostensibly evolutionarily determined genetic organizing principle of our Liberal Humanist own, as expressed in the empirical hierarchies of race and class (together with the kind of gender role allocation between men and women needed to keep these systemic hierarchies in place), is as fundamentally secured by our present disciplines of the Humanities and Social Sciences. Given that once the physical and the biological sciences had, after long struggles, freed human knowledge of the physical and biological levels of reality, from having to verify, as they still did in the feudal-European and all other pre-Sixteenth century human cultures, the "truth" or mode of subjective understanding/inner eyes on whose basis the role allocation system of each order can alone be perceived as having been extra-humanly determined, and therefore as just, only the "truths" with respect to our knowledge of the social reality of which we are subjects (and therefore always already subjected and socialized agents/observers), could now be deployed to verify the ostensible extra-human, because bioevolutionary determined nature of our present status-organizing principle based on the code of "Race. " As the Liberal analogue therefore of the feudal code of "Caste. " My proposal here therefore is that it is only on the basis of the classificatory logic of our present Humanities and Social Sciences, and its related mode of subjective understanding or "inner eyes" generated from the representation of the human as an evolutionarily selected organism, (and who can therefore be more or less human, even totally lacking in humanness as in the case of the N.H.I.), that we can be induced to see all those outside our present "sanctified universe of obligation," whether as racial or as Jobless Other, as having been placed in their inferiorized status, not by our culture-specific institutional mechanisms but rather by the extra-human ordering of bio-evolutionary Natural Selection. That our global and nation-state socio-systemic hierarchies are therefore the expression, not of the prescriptive categories of our now globalized cultural epistemological model, but of the, in the last instance, evolutionarily pre-selected degrees of eugenic "worth" between human groups at the level of race, culture, religion, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and sex. THE NEW QUESTION, FROM WOODSON TO WIESEL TO ORR: WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR EDUCATION? The central institutional mechanisms which integrate and regulate our present world system, I propose here, are the prescriptive categories of our present order of knowledge, as disseminated in our present global university system and its correlated textbook industry. How and why is this so? Paul Ricœur has based himself on the thesis of Clifford Geertz that "ideology is a function of human cultural systems," to propose that the systems of knowledge by which human orders know themselves, must serve to provide a "generalized horizon of understanding" able to induce the collective behaviours of each order's subjects. Since these are the behaviours by means of which each order is integrated and made stably replicable as such an order, without such horizons of understanding or "inner eyes," no human order could exist [Ricœur, 1979]. Legesse further suggests that all mainstream scholars necessarily function as the grammarians of our order; that is, as "men and women" who are well-versed in the "techniques of ordering a select body of facts within a framework that is completely consistent with the system of values, the weltanschauung and, above all, the cognitive model" of the society7

-Copernicus Christian-Ptolemaic astronomy), the ostensibly evolutionarily determined genetic organizing principle of our Liberal Humanist own, as expressed in the empirical hierarchies of race and class (together with the kind of gender role allocation between men and women needed to keep these systemic hierarchies in place), is as fundamentally secured by our present disciplines of the Humanities and Social Sciences. Given that once the physical and the biological sciences had, after long struggles, freed human knowledge of the physical and biological levels of reality, from having to verify, as they still did in the feudal-European and all other pre-Sixteenth century human cultures, the "truth" or mode of subjective understanding/inner eyes on whose basis the role allocation system of each order can alone be perceived as having been extra-humanly determined, and therefore as just, only the "truths" with respect to our knowledge of the social reality of which we are subjects (and therefore always already subjected and socialized agents/observers), could now be deployed to verify the ostensible extra-human, because bioevolutionary determined nature of our present status-organizing principle based on the code of "Race. " As the Liberal analogue therefore of the feudal code of "Caste. " My proposal here therefore is that it is only on the basis of the classificatory logic of our present Humanities and Social Sciences, and its related mode of subjective understanding or "inner eyes" generated from the representation of the human as an evolutionarily selected organism, (and who can therefore be more or less human, even totally lacking in humanness as in the case of the N.H.I.), that we can be induced to see all those outside our present "sanctified universe of obligation," whether as racial or as Jobless Other, as having been placed in their inferiorized status, not by our culture-specific institutional mechanisms but rather by the extra-human ordering of bio-evolutionary Natural Selection. That our global and nation-state socio-systemic hierarchies are therefore the expression, not of the prescriptive categories of our now globalized cultural epistemological model, but of the, in the last instance, evolutionarily pre-selected degrees of eugenic "worth" between human groups at the level of race, culture, religion, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and sex. THE NEW QUESTION, FROM WOODSON TO WIESEL TO ORR: WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR EDUCATION? The central institutional mechanisms which integrate and regulate our present world system, I propose here, are the prescriptive categories of our present order of knowledge, as disseminated in our present global university system and its correlated textbook industry. How and why is this so? Paul Ricœur has based himself on the thesis of Clifford Geertz that "ideology is a function of human cultural systems," to propose that the systems of knowledge by which human orders know themselves, must serve to provide a "generalized horizon of understanding" able to induce the collective behaviours of each order's subjects.
